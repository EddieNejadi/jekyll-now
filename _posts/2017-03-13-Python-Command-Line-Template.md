summary: An account of my python cli templates
---

I have created an [github repository - cli](https://github.com/EddieNejadi/cli) to write my cli template there and share it with others.

## Python
I got inspired from Writing Awesome Command-Line Programs in Python by Mark Smith and started to write an python cli template.
